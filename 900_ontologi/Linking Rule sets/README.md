# Linking Rule Sets
The Linking Rule Sets are created as separate ontologies importing the linked ontologies and providing the linking statements. The advantages of this is that the linked ontologies are kept untouched and clean. 

Importing the Linking Rule Set provides the collected set of statements included in the linked ontologies as well as the linking statements from the Linking Rule Set itself.
